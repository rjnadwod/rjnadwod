# About Me

I’m a DevOps Engineer who’s passionate about building reliable, secure, and automated systems that help developers move faster with confidence. My work lives at the intersection of software development, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD automation, where I focus on making deployments smoother, code safer, and systems more resilient.

Right now, I’m part of the team at Quarterhill, where I design, maintain, and optimize GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins pipelines for both monorepo and microservice architectures. I manage Docker and Podman images for production deployments, handle compliance-driven patching of WebLogic and Oracle Database containers, and integrate SAST and dependency scanning into our workflows to catch vulnerabilities early. My favorite part of the job? Turning complex, fragile pipelines into automated, repeatable systems that just work.

Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Vitech Systems Group, developing enterprise applications with Java (8/11/17), Spring Boot, Maven, and React. I also wrote plenty of PL/pgSQL and Oracle SQL for data migrations and deployments — giving me a strong understanding of how app code, infrastructure, and databases fit together.

Earlier in my career at Western Union, I interned as a DevOps Engineer, automating CI tasks with Jenkins and PowerShell, improving workflows across AWS, Docker, and CloudBees, and learning what it really takes to build and scale global infrastructure.

A few of my favorite technical highlights include:

🚀 Migrating complex Jenkins pipelines to GitLab CI/CD, using YAML, Bash, and caching/parallelization to cut build times by over 40%.

🔒 Integrating static application security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning into legacy CI/CD pipelines to harden deployments.

🧰 Building efficient, lightweight Docker and Podman images for microservices and legacy systems alike.

Tech I love working with:
🧱 GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Docker, Podman, Bash, YAML, PowerShell
☁️ AWS, WebLogic, Oracle Database, Cloud automation tools
💻 Java, Spring Boot, React, SQL, PL/pgSQL
🔒 SAST, dependency scanning, patching, security compliance

I’m always looking for ways to make software delivery faster, safer, and more transparent. Whether it’s automating builds, optimizing infrastructure, or collaborating with developers, my goal is simple — build systems that let people focus on writing great code.
